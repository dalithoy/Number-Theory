# Number-Theory
Intro to Number Theory. IIT Dharwad.

### Tips
- Assignments give a good understanding of the topics.
- Although the prof wanted the students to learn thorough proof-writing, this was largely not tested in evaluation.
- Solving questions (not all, just ones that seem relevant) from Gehring & Halmos is very helpful in gaining confidence in the subject.
- If there are video recorded lectures, go with 2x playback :P
